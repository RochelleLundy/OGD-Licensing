- Case study of open data in Chicago - attempt to analyze open data project happening at local level rather than considering political motivations/processes behind broader OGD movement
- &quot;The governmental _open data project_ can be described as an official web-portal launched at the federal or local level aimed at making certain types of governmental datasets publicly accessible via internet in a machine readable format.&quot;
- Analyzes the legal basis for OGD at multiple levels - Federal (FOIA, Obama memorandum), State (Illinois FOIA), City (none yet in Chicago - data opened on city initiative)
- Reviews history of Chicago open data and citizen open data uses/projects
- Argues that local open data has potential to realize civic engagement, economic, and transparency benefits that have proven more difficult in OGD programs at higher levels

- Conducts descriptive research &quot;on features and content of open data portals in American cities&quot; and develops indices by which city portals can be scored and compared, concluding that &quot;results indicate portals are in a very early stage of development and need a great deal of work to improve user help and analysis features as well as inclusion of features to help citizens understand the data, such as more charting and analysis&quot;
- Note that &quot;[t]here has yet been little systematic and empirical research on the subject of open data portals at the American sub-national level.&quot;
- Assume that portal datasets are all machine-readable and openly licensed - &quot;Most of these features are not relevant for our research project, as by definition the data in American urban open data portals is publicly available online and is machine-readable in digital format plus openly licensed….For this research project on American urban open data portals, these features are all assumed to be included.&quot;
- Sample selection - &quot;The cities chosen were all those listed by the United States government premier data portal (data.gov) in their cities section ( [http://www.data.gov/open-gov/](http://www.data.gov/open-gov/)). The list from data.gov contained 37 cities (counties were not included in this study). Of these, Atlanta was not included in the study because it required an account and password to enter and therefore, was not considered &quot;open.&quot; Other listings of possible cities, such as [org](http://dataportals.org/) (supported by the Open Knowledge Foundation) were available but, data.gov was considered to be the definitive site. All of the open data portals offered by American cities listed in data.gov and so, in our study provide publicly available data for free, in digital format, online and openly licensed. Providing data with these features is simply how these projects are all structured.&quot;
- Compare portals to a number of existing models and frameworks, as well as to each other
- Note predominance of Socrata platform among US city portals, which serves to make features similar (and similarly limited) across portals

- Conducts &quot;a broad empirical exploration of municipal data release in the City of Seattle&quot; by interviewing both city personnel and third parties affected by/interested in open data release, with particular attention to risk inherent opening city data, and examining legal terms of city&#39;s contracts with third parties involved in generation and/or release of data
- Observe that minimal research has been done on OGD at the local level - &quot; For example, Maxat Kassen has observed: [I]t is not yet clear how the potential of the open data concept can be realized at the local level as there has been no analysis of current projects so far. The concept is still in its infancy, and in fact it gained a political meaning primarily after the launch of the official U.S. government data portal in 2009. Later, similar data projects were initiated at the local level. Maxat Kassen, A promising phenomenon of open data: A case study of the Chicago open data project, 30 GOV&#39;T INFO.

Q. 17, 17 (2014) (&quot;[V]ery little systematic and structured research has been done on the issues that are covered by open data policies, their intent and actual impact. Furthermore, no suitable framework for comparing open data policies is available.&quot;). As recently as 2011, the International City/County Management Agency national survey of e-Government did not include questions on open data. Donald F. Norris &amp; Christopher G.

- &quot;[E]xamines the challenges and the expectations that civic hackers bring to the use of open government data, building on Gurstein&#39;s theory of barriers to effective use&quot; through interviews and focus group with Seattle civic hackers
- Notes discrepancy between data &#39;objects&#39; and &#39;datasets&#39; on Seattle portal – &quot;there were 2,704 &#39;objects&#39; published on data.Seattle.gov2 , drawn from 797 datasets and maps&quot; – majority of objects are filtered views derived from an underlying dataset
- Population represents &quot;data enthusiasts&quot;, people already familiar with technology and data analysis, many at a professional level - not everyday citizen using/looking at OGD
- Gurstein&#39;s theory of &quot;effective use&quot; – mere opportunity to use vs. realization of transformative potential
- Previous work reflects 1) data quality as an obstacle to OGD use; 2) fact that OGD is limited to a small % of the population with significant technical skills
- Civic hackers don&#39;t see themselves as limited to data on an OGD portal - will request or seek out data directly from government or other sources
- Review participant challenges and expectations around a) Data Portal Usability and b) Dataset Quality - particular frustrations regarding lack of transparency as to what data is made available by city, lack of consistent and complete metadata, and difficulties utilizing API

- Examine 20 open data portals from Australia&#39;s largest cities for variation in capabilities across portals over 2 separate time periods (&quot;longitudinal analysis&quot;)
- Summary table of previous articles analyzing open data portals, including level of jurisdiction (i.e. federal, local, etc.) [Table 1]
  - Notes Petychakis et al. analysis, including licensing, of federal-level portals
  - Notes local portal analysis across US (Thorsby et al.) and China (Bui), as well as analyses of NYC portal (Okamoto) and Denver portal (Oliveira &amp; Moreno)
    - Denver &amp; NYC papers both very short and no mention of licensing or use restriction issues
- Sampling methodology - &quot;A total of twenty largest local governments (or city and regional councils) were selected based on the official Estimated Resident Population (ERP) values ( [Australian Bureau of Statistics, 2015](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0740624X16302283#bb0035))....Our rationale for the inclusion of the larger local governments is that the planning, launch and operation of dedicated government data portal at the local government level requires substantial resource allocation and commitment such as capital, technology and human resources.&quot;
- Particularly interested in &#39;intensity&#39; of open data policy in relation to observed &#39;openness&#39; of portals
- No discussion of licensing or other use restrictions/terms of service

- &quot;This paper analyses the implementation of the Open Government Data strategy and portal of the City of Vienna. This evaluation is based on qualitative interviews and online polls after the strategy was implemented. Two groups of users were involved in the evaluation: internal target groups (employees and heads of department in the City of Vienna&#39;s public administration departments) and external stakeholders (citizens, business representatives, science and research, journalists).&quot;

- &quot;Common themes&quot; from team presentations included &quot;[a]ggregating data from government open data portals, Census statistics, social media, demographics, and socioeconomic indicators to look for patterns across populations, neighborhoods and regions,&quot; &quot;[d]evoting significant resources to data cleaning and processing to identify and account for inconsistencies or differing standards across resources,&quot; &quot;[s]eeking additional resources when data limitations are discovered, such as finding summaries rather than raw data in open data portals, or finding PDFs instead of an accessible and comprehensive database.&quot;
