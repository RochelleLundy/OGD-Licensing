- As part of larger review, briefly mentions 1) that there is no agreed-upon open licensing standard, which may prevent interoperability issues, and 2) that dataset ownership among public entities is often unclear, particular where data may be shared between multiple entities, which can hinder data publication in the first place and/or result in contradictions in publication terms (citing as examples: [Conradie &amp; Choenni, 2012](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0740624X1500091X#bb0060)), ( [Eckartz et al., 2014](file:///h)), ( [Zuiderwijk &amp; Janssen, 2014b](file:///h))

Barry, E., &amp; Bannister, F. (2014). Barriers to open data release: A view from the top. _Information Polity, 19_(1-2), 129-152.

- Examines view of barriers to open data release by interviewing Irish government officials and conducting documentary analysis - select Ireland because it has been relatively slow to open data in comparison to other European countries - compares these to barriers noted in literature, and creates a taxonomy of open data barriers
- “Open data is one of those expressions that is often used without being defined...Even where it is defined, definitions are sometimes loose or vague.”
- Review previous studies on open data barriers -- Look at: S. Martin, M. Foulonneau, S. Turki and M. Ihadjadene, open data: Barriers, Risks and Opportunities, in: Proceedings of the 13th European Conference on e-Government, E. Ferrari and W. Castelnovo, eds, Como, Italy, Reading, ACPI, 2013,pp. 301–309. (creates barrier category for licenses/legal framework & based on research in French & German cities)
- Conducted interviews with managers in both national and local government agencies/authorities (“used a government agency as a proxy for central government”)
- One category in resulting taxonomy of barriers is “Legal”, which includes “Legislation”, “Licensing”, and “Litigation & Liability” - note that legal barriers were much more frequently mentioned by national rather than local employees w/r/t opening data
- With regard to “Litigation & Liability”, interviewees expressed that risk of data misuse or release of personal data could be mitigated by terms of use, but “[t]he main difficulty appeared to be around the terms and conditions of use and the difficulty in perpetuating these terms and conditions throughout a process which could include an unknown number of third parties.”
- With regard to “Licensing”, interviewees expressed the need for “robust licensing”, but their primary concern was with agency liability more than user experience - authors describe as a “defensive” attitude toward opening government data

- Participatory action research with City of Rotterdam, examining barriers to open data release with 6 public service agencies
- Includes occasional discussion of licensing concerns from city agency perspective, including loss of potential licensing revenue and uncertainty as to applicability of open designations such as CC0 in particular contexts (i.e. third-party data, photographs, etc.)

- General examination of challenges to opening across a variety of public sectors, particularly in European setting
- Notes that even &#39;open&#39; licenses may present incompatibility issues, and that customized, country-specific licenses can heighten this (as well as potentially being more intimidating to interpret) - i.e. can raise transaction costs for data use, even when include &#39;compatibility clauses&#39; designed to mitigate these issues
- Question whether there is ever a need for country-specific licensing - reference as &#39;vanity&#39; licenses - and whether these are driven by exaggerated concerns about need to disclaim liability for illegal or otherwise inappropriate data use by end-users
- References include studies of CC &amp; other license interoperability issues

- High-level discussion of reasons for and concepts behind OD licensing - main thrust appears to be a critique of the idea that data could or should be released without any licensing regime, as well as discussion of suitability of specific CC/ODC licenses for OGD
- &quot;This paper examines open government data licensing and explores a number of its dimensions. Its objectives are to highlight the complexities surrounding this topic, to examine some of these and to critique the current approach to open government data (OGD) licensing.&quot;
- Collects limited amount of licensing-related literature, and points out that licensing-related problems (i.e. interoperability, reluctance to use unlicensed data, etc.) tend to be assumed rather than tested or discussed with specific examples

- &quot;This Article focuses on the legal issues associated with OGD licenses….This study compares current open data licenses and argues that licensing terms reflect policy considerations, which are quite different from those contemplated in business transactions or shared in typical commons communities. This Article investigates the ambiguous legal status of data together with the new wave of OGD, which concerns some fundamental IP questions not covered by, or analyzed in depth in, the current literature. Moreover, this study suggests that governments should choose or adapt OGD licenses according to their own IP regimes. For example, whether a database right is protected as a sui generis right and whether moral rights are waivable in the subject jurisdiction both lead to licensing terms being designed differently.&quot;
- Emphasizes idea that OGD licensing should stem from policy goals - licensing and related legal issues should be coordinated with broader aims of OGD program
- Discusses emergence of customized local OGD licenses with &#39;compatibility provisions&#39; to facilitate interoperability with standard open licenses
- Notes that licenses are often contradicted by terms of use - example of FDA terms of use, which offers CC0 data but imposes an attribution requirement in terms of use
- Extensive discussion of underlying IP rights in data and potential effect of licensing data in which there may not be underlying ownership
- Analyzes potential reasons for frequent imposition of attribution requirement, indicating that there is no underlying &#39;moral rights&#39;-style reason for it, but that it makes sense in light of the transparency and accountability goals of many OGD programs

- Aims to determine the &#39;openness&#39; of open data by examining license/legal restriction status of datasets across main OGD portals for EU countries,  UK, Norway, US, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, Argentina, Chile, Uruguay through collection of metadata for 400,000+ datasets
- Reports that ~90% of licenses associated with datasets examined are &#39;local&#39;, country-specific licenses rather than standardized licenses
- Conducts in-depth analysis of the underlying legal framework and  current licensing practices and portal restrictions/terms for Italy, Lithuania, and the UK

- Brief article providing a general overview of open government data licensing, primarily from a European perspective, and the potential for license interoperability
- Includes an argument for the importance of licenses to OGD, including quotations and citations
- Includes discussion of interoperability issues among CC/ODC licenses and license compatibility chart, noting that custom licenses often include additional clauses (not necessarily related to IP issues - i.e. liability, etc.) that can make compatibility even mroe uncertain
- Emphasizes that the uncertainty and arguments around license compatibility is symptomatic of a larger issue - if scholars can&#39;t agree on compatibility, how can data users be expected to evaluate them when seeking to combine datasets?

- Proposes a framework by which to compare open data policies and applies it to policies within Dutch national government entities (i.e. national vs. ministerial vs. agency not national vs. sub-national/local)
- “Currently there is a multiplicity of open data policies at various levels of government, whereas very little systematic and structured research has been done on the issues that are covered by open data policies, their intent and actual impact.”
- “Although federal United States and European Union open data policies have gained considerable attention, the policies at lower levels have largely been neglected…”
- Note that policy can often emerge without explicit decision-making (i.e. failure to act) - important to look at what isn’t publicized or touted as an official ‘policy’ too
- “Moreover, the attitude towards openness influences the open data policy, as organizations that develop an open data policy but mainly focus on the risks of becoming open remain more closed in their open data policy than the organizations that develop an open data policy because they aim to become more open.”
- Compare licensing policies across the entities studied - national government uses 7 different licenses for OD, although primarily designate data as ‘public domain; one ministry uses one specific license type; other ministries/agencies either do not apply licenses to OD or licensing policy is unclear
- “Yet there seems to be a large gap between the key objectives of the open data policies which reflect the ambitions of politicians, on the one hand, and, on the other hand, the realities of public servants working for the government organizations.”
- Authors suggest that one way OGD policy-making could be improved is through greater alignment of licenses, both within and between organizations

- &quot;Open licensing is a problem, and we cannot assess public domain status. Each year we find ourselves more confused about open data licences. On the one hand, more governments implement their unique open data license versions. Some of them are compliant with the Open Definition, but most are not officially acknowledged. On the other hand, some governments do not provide open licenses, but terms of use, that may leave users in the dark about the actual possibilities to reuse data. There is a need to draw more attention to data licenses and make sure data producers understand how to license data better….&quot;

- Census report Indicates only whether datasets meet an &quot;openly licensed&quot; benchmark (i.e. are attached to an Open Definition-conformant license) on the basis of community input
- Unlike the Global Index, there does not appear to be reviewer commentary indicating how licensing assessments were made or where relevant information was found - for at least some of the datasets, the reported licensing information was not apparent or listed as &#39;unspecified&#39; despite the dataset being assessed as &quot;openly licensed&quot; when the linked landing page was visited
